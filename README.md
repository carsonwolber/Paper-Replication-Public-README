# Paper-Replication-README
A public README for my private Replication Project repository. This was the final project for Fall 2023 ECON3171: Causal Reasoning and Policy Evaluation. The project consisted of a partial replication of Jones, Damon, David Molitor, and Julian Reif. 2019. “What do Workplace Wellness Programs do? Evidence from the Illinois Workplace Wellness Study.” Quarterly Journal of Economics, 134(4): 1747-1791. (https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjz023). Tables I, II, and III from the original paper were replicated as well as table A.5f from the paper appendix.
